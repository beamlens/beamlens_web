Review the current project. I want to prep it for release to Hex. I want the code to be clean, effective. Install any tools you need to get it up and running for yourself, or at least to be able to run the tests. It might be helpful to set up some sort of test harness to be able to test the actual integration with the Phoenix application. Follow the workflow: research, plan, implement, test. And you can go back to any of those steps at any point. And every action you take within each of those steps should be small and simple, and you should commit all steps along the way. Any research or planning that you do, write out in documents in the specs directory. During implementation and testing, read from the specs directory.
